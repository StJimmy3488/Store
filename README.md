<h1>Online Store with Administration Panel</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This online store is a final Project for SDA's 'Java from Scratch' course. 
Main aim was to practice using Spring Boot, but we also did some front-end development 
to get more familiar with front-end technologies. The aim of this application is 
to sell different products in online store. 
- Products are divided in categories. Customers can 
search products, add to cart, proceed to checkout.
- Administrators can manage (add, update, delete) products and categories, manage carts and orders.

<h3>Technologies used</h3>
Spring Boot + Java 11, MySQL, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, ThymeLeaf + Thymeleaf Layout Dialect, CSS Bootstrap5
